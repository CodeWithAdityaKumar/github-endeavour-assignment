Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes to your code and collaborate with others. Here are some of the most common Git commands:

git init: This command initializes a new Git repository.

git add: This command adds files to the staging area. The staging area is a collection of files that you are ready to commit

git commit: This command commits the staged files to the Git repository. A commit is a snapshot of your code at a particular point in time.

git status: This command shows you the status of your Git repository. It will tell you which files have been added, modified, or deleted, and which files are staged for commit.

git clone: This command clones an existing Git repository to your local machine. This is how you get a copy of a repository that someone else has created.

git push: This command pushes your local commits to a remote repository. A remote repository is a copy of your repository that is stored on a server.

git pull: This command pulls changes from a remote repository to your local machine. This is how you get the latest changes from a repository that someone else has made.

git checkout: This command switches you to a different branch.

git merge: This command merges two branches together. Merging is the process of combining the changes from two branches into a single branch.
